//
// service-worker-assets.js is generated at publish by the static web assets SDK: every asset
// with its integrity hash, plus a version derived from those hashes.
//
// Storage is split in two, because the runtime and the game content age differently.
//
//   Shell cache   — the .NET runtime and the page shell, named after the manifest version and
//                   replaced wholesale when it changes. The runtime files are fingerprinted, so
//                   a new build requests new URLs for those regardless; index.html and the loose
//                   .js files are not, and the version in the cache name is what retires them.
//                   Two runtimes are published and a visit runs one, so the framework trees are
//                   filled by the fetch path as the page asks for them rather than at install.
//   Content cache — the ~36MB under content/, kept across versions. These URLs are stable, so
//                   a cached entry stays valid until its bytes actually change. Each entry
//                   records the manifest hash it was stored from, and activation drops only
//                   the entries whose hash no longer matches. A publish that touches nothing
//                   but code therefore re-downloads nothing here.
//
// The worker and the web manifest are deliberately absent from both. The browser revalidates
// this file on every navigation, which is the only thing that notices a new deployment;
// serving it from a cache it controls would leave it unable to replace itself.
